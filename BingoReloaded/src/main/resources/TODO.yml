(2.1) refactor card recovery (its shit).

(2.1) implement Vault rewards

(2.1) add /bingo info command to see information about current game (settings mostly) (admin use only)

(2.1) add Free for all (probably needs a new TeamManager)

(2.1) add Hologram wizard item to /bingo hologram to allow players to place scoreboards in the world

(2.1) add player voting commands to multi auto bingo

(2.1) finish multiworld and TEST (using premade worlds or multiverse?)

(2.1) Fix bingo creator not showing updated lists/cards immediately after creating them (only after reopening menu)

(2.1) vote item does not appear when starting server sometimes

(2.1) Auto team is not treated like a proper team, meaning events involving auto team will be convoluted and leave participants as null
(participants cannot be made from the autoteam)
adding a participantCountChanged event would help with a lot of this probably
